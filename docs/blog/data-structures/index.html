They are a way to store multiple items (elements) of the same datatype together in a contiguous block of memory. This collection allows a programmer to efficiently manage a group of variables of the same type by using a single name and an index (to indicate the position).</p><p>These are the various real-world use cases of arrays:</p><ol><li><strong>Storing and Processing Tabular Data</strong>: Arrays are used when you have a significant amount of data of the same type that can be stored in a table-like format. Examples include but are not limited to, storing student grades, statistical data, or pixel values of an image.</li><li><strong>Sorting and Searching</strong>: They are useful in arranging data in a specific order. This is primarily because every element in the array is equally accessible, which makes sorting algorithms efficient.</li><li><strong>Buffers</strong>: &ldquo;Buffer&rdquo; data structures that temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another are often implemented as arrays.</li><li><strong>Multi-Dimensional Data</strong>: They are not limited to a single dimension. Instead, they can have multiple dimensions, making them suitable for mathematical computations on matrices.</li><li><strong>Implementing Other Data Structures</strong>: Arrays can be used to implement other more complex data structures like Stack, Queue, Heap, Hash Map etc.</li><li><strong>Lookup tables and Dictionaries</strong>: Arrays can be used to store records with keys and values where lookup operation is essential.</li><li><strong>String Representation</strong>: In a lot of languages, strings are represented as an array of characters.</li></ol><p>In brief, arrays are a fundamental data structure that provides an essential tool for managing multiple data items effectively and are a building block for more complex data structures. They have diverse applications across various fields like databases, algorithms, graphics, and many more.</p><hr><h2 id=stacks>Stacks</h2><p>A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed.

In a physical analogy, you can think of it like a stack of plates. You add (<strong>push</strong>) a new plate to the top of the stack and also remove (<strong>pop</strong>) plates from the top of the stack.</p><p>Here are some of the many practical uses for stacks in software development:</p><ol><li><strong>Function Calls and Recursion</strong>: Stacks are used in function calls and recursion. When a function is called, the return address, data, etc., are pushed onto a call stack. When the called function has finished running, this data is then popped off the stack, and control goes back to the returned address.</li><li><strong>Parsing</strong>: Stacks are used in compilers and parsers. For example, stacks are used for syntax checking of expressions like balanced symbols such as <code>{}</code>, <code>[]</code>, <code>()</code> and so on.</li><li><strong>Expression evaluation and Conversion</strong>: Stacks are used for evaluating prefix, infix and postfix arithmetic expressions. They are also used for converting an infix expression to postfix or prefix expressions.</li><li><strong>Undo Operations</strong>: In many modern text editors or word processors, the &ldquo;undo&rdquo; operation can go back many steps, undoing a series of user actions. A stack can keep track of those actions as they occur, making it easy to &ldquo;pop&rdquo; the most recent action in order to undo it.</li><li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong>: In tree or graph data structures, a depth-first search can be implemented using stacks.</li><li><strong>Backtracking Algorithms</strong>: Backtracking algorithms like maze, finding paths, exhaustive search etc., often use stacks to store intermediate states.</li></ol><p>Stacks are particularly useful when the exact number of elements in the collection is not known beforehand and can change dynamically, but access to any elements other than the top one isn&rsquo;t required or can be restricted. The simple push and pop operations allow for efficient management of the collection with a LIFO access pattern.</p><hr><h2 id=queues>Queues</h2><p>A Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is <strong>First-In-First-Out</strong> (<strong>FIFO</strong>).</p><p>Queues are used when you want to have access to elements in a First-In-First-Out manner. They&rsquo;re commonly used to handle asynchronous data transfers (like printing documents on a printer), or in scenarios that involve a processing order, such as serving requests on a single shared resource like a printer, CPU task scheduling, etc.</p><h3 id=infographics-2>Infographics</h3><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-text data-lang=text><span class=line><span class=cl>    ENQUEUE(1)                    ENQUEUE(2)                     ENQUEUE(3)                     DEQUEUE()

This means that the item that&rsquo;s been in a queue the longest, is the first one to get removed.</p><p>Here are some of the practical applications of queues in the real world:</p><ol><li><strong>Handling Asynchronous Tasks</strong>: In web development, a queue data structure can be used to handle asynchronous tasks, like sending emails, logging activity, etc. Tasks are added to the queue and are processed in the order they were added.</li><li><strong>Scheduling in Operating Systems</strong>: Queues are widely used in operating system scheduling algorithms. Processes are scheduled based on their priorities (priority queues), or on a first-come basis (regular queues).</li><li><strong>Breadth First Search (BFS)</strong>: In graph theory, a breadth-first search algorithm uses a queue to visit nodes or vertices. It visits vertices in a breadthward motion and uses a queue to remember to get the next vertex to start the search when a dead-end occurs in any iteration.</li><li><strong>Buffering in Data Communication and IO Buffers</strong>: Queues are used for buffering data in routers, streaming services, or print spooling. Data sent between two communication protocols is often of varying speeds. Thus, if the sending protocol produces data at a faster rate than the receiving protocol can consume, a buffer is used to queue up the sent data.</li><li><strong>Waiting Calls</strong>: A good example of queue is the handling of waiting calls in a call center.</li><li><strong>CPU Scheduling, Disk Scheduling</strong>: Where operations are backed up into a buffer and then scheduled based on priority, time of arrival, or other factors.</li></ol><p>The essential feature of the queue is that it inserts at the end and removes from the beginning, allowing it to maintain the FIFO structure. This orderly and disciplined process makes it applicable for scenarios where it&rsquo;s important to maintain the order of the elements.</p><hr><h2 id=linked-lists>Linked Lists</h2><p>A linked list stores elements in a node.

In a singly linked list, this connection is in one direction, and in a doubly linked list, nodes also reference the previous node. Here are some practical uses for linked lists:</p><ol><li><strong>Dynamic Memory Allocation</strong>: If we need a data structure whose size can change during runtime, linked lists are a good choice. Since they are not stored in contiguous memory locations, their size can be increased or decreased easily.</li><li><strong>Implementing Stacks and Queues</strong>: Both stacks and queues can be easily implemented using linked lists. A stack is a Last-In-First-Out structure, and a queue is a First-In-First-Out structure. For both of these use cases, elements can be added and removed efficiently from a linked list.</li><li><strong>Graph Representations</strong>: Linked lists can be used to represent graphs. The nodes can represent graph vertices and the edges can be represented by links.</li><li><strong>Polynomial Arithmetic</strong>: Linked lists are used in representing and manipulating polynomials. Each node can represent a term of the polynomial.</li><li><strong>Creating Music Playlists</strong>: If you have ever used a music playlist, that&rsquo;s where linked lists come into action. Songs can be played in a sequence, shuffled or replayed again, you can also go to the next or the previous songs, all these operations can be implemented using a linked list, where each node points to the next song.</li><li><strong>Navigation systems</strong>: Systems like web browser history for &ldquo;back&rdquo; and &ldquo;forward&rdquo; are implemented using doubly linked list, you can go back to the previous visited website, and also you can go forward.</li></ol><p>Unlike arrays, linked lists have some overhead as they must store pointers to other nodes. However, because they&rsquo;re linked, it is easy to insert and delete nodes from them without having to shift or reorganize an entire block of memory. Also, unlike arrays, linked lists do not provide constant time access to a particular node. If you want to get to the nth node of a linked list, you have to start at the first node and follow the links until you get to the nth node.</p><hr><h2 id=trees>Trees</h2><p>A tree is a non-linear data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a set of linked nodes.

The key feature of an AVL tree is that it tries to keep the &lsquo;balance&rsquo; (i.e., the height difference of left subtree and right subtree) of every node not more than 1. This ensures all operations are performed in O(log n) time.</li><li><strong>Red-Black Tree</strong>: A type of self-balancing binary search tree, where each node has an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black.
