**Programming Becoming More Abstracted**

_Today, the traditional gatekeeping of code is dissolving. Tools like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Bubble, and Manus are enabling managers, designers, and other non-devs to translate vague specs into functional prototypes — or even deployable applications._

_What used to take teams of developers now sometimes takes a few clever prompts and a drag-and-drop interface. It feels like magic. But it comes with a cost!_

## Engineers Are Becoming Code Custodians

Developers may no longer be writing every line of code. Instead, they’ll be the ones:

- Refactoring bloated or brittle code generated by AI or built by non-technical users.
- Ensuring systems meet performance, security, and scalability standards.
- Fixing bugs in layers of abstraction they didn’t create.
- Acting as “AI wranglers,” guiding copilots with better prompts and validating results.

As GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke recently put it, “Smart companies are hiring more developers, not fewer.” Not to replace them with AI — but to empower them to do more with AI. To collaborate with machines, not compete against them.

And yet, paradoxically, some companies are laying off developers while doubling down on automation. There’s a disconnect between the hype and the actual need for skilled human judgment in an AI-heavy stack.

## The Hidden Problems in This Brave New Code

This also raises new challenges:

- Overengineering: Non-devs or AI often build solutions that are far more complex than necessary.
- Technical Debt Explosion: AI writes a lot of code fast — but that doesn’t mean it writes good code.
- Loss of Craft: When code is just a byproduct of prompts, software craftsmanship risks being sidelined.

Developers spend less time building beautiful, intentional systems — and more time cleaning up after others.

It’s not unlike being asked to maintain a city that was auto-generated by a procedural game engine: things technically work, but none of it makes sense until a human rewires the grid.

## What Might Save It

There are promising solutions on the horizon:

- AI Guardrails: Smarter models that can detect poor architecture and flag inefficient code.
- Stricter DevOps Hygiene: Automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and static analysis become mission-critical.
- Human-in-the-Loop: Developers remain essential to bridge business needs and AI output, using domain knowledge and ethical thinking.

## Managers, PMs, and Designers : Welcome to the Code Party

These shifts also give non-engineers new superpowers:

- Quickly generate prototypes and experiment.
- Communicate ideas with working code instead of wireframes.
- Iterate faster on product feedback.

But they should carry the responsibilities. It’s easy to generate code — harder to understand its implications, scalability, or security risks.

## So What’s a Developer’s Job Now?

The future of programming isn’t about writing every line…

It’s about:

- Architecture — designing robust, scalable systems.
- Debugging — making sense of AI-generated abstractions.
- Ethics — knowing when not to build.
- Integration — ensuring everything works cohesively.
- Reviewing — catching what AI (or managers) miss.

In short: it’s about judgment, not just syntax.

## Are Developers Becoming Janitors for AI?

Let’s be honest. The future of programming might not be about creating from scratch. It might be about optimizing chaos. Making sense of the mess that others or machines leave behind. Code isn’t the craft anymore.

What do you think? 

Are we heading into a golden age of software empowerment or a fragile tower of auto-generated spaghetti?
